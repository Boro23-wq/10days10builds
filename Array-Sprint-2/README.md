# 10days10builds
Build projects constantly for 10 days. Inspired by Florin Pop and Kalle Hadden's #100days100projects challenge.

# Day 5
Array Sprints Day-2 where we worked and iterated concepts on some more array methods in Javascript. A good sprint of methods as they can come very handy when dealing with data.

# Concepts Covered:
* Array.prototype.some()
* Array.prototype.every()
* Array.prototype.find()
* Array.prototype.findIndex()
* Find and Index and remove it using splice and es6's spread operator.
